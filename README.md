# Python Basics Exercises Exercise 1

## Project Overview
This project contains **30 beginner-friendly Python exercises** covering the fundamentals of Python programming.
It is designed for practice and learning through simple examples including:

- Variables and data types
- Arithmetic operations
- User input
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- Functions

All solutions are written in Python and organized as **Q1 → Q30** in a single file.

## File Included
- `Room 3 - Exercise 1.py` — Contains solutions for exercises **Q1 to Q30**

## Topics Covered

### Variables & Printing
- Q1, Q5

### Arithmetic Operations
- Q2, Q3, Q4, Q7

### User Input
- Q6, Q7, Q8, Q14, Q16

### Comparisons & Conditions
- Q9, Q10, Q11, Q12, Q13, Q15, Q16

### Loops
- `for` loop: Q17, Q18, Q20
- `while` loop: Q19

### Data Structures
- Lists: Q21–Q24
- Tuples: Q25
- Sets: Q26
- Dictionaries: Q27–Q28

### Functions
- Q29, Q30


## ▶️ How to Run

### Option 1:Run as a Python file (Recommended)

### Option 2: Copy & paste into a Python editor
You can copy individual questions into:
- VS Code
- PyCharm
- Jupyter Notebook
- Online Python compiler


## Important Notes
- Most lines are **commented out** using `#`.
- To test any question, **uncomment its code** by removing `#` from the lines you want to run.

Example:
#Q5
#print("Python is fun")

Becomes:
print("Python is fun")


## Learning Outcomes:

- Writing basic Python syntax correctly
- Working with input/output
- Building logic using conditions and loops
- Using Python data structures
- Creating simple reusable functions
