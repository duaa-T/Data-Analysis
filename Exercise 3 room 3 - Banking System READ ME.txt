# 🏦 Bank Account Management System (Python OOP Project)
 
 
## Project Overview
 
This project is a **Bank Account Management System** built using **Python** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.
 
The project was designed to demonstrate a clear, practical understanding of the four core pillars of OOP:
 
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
 
 
## OOP Design Philosophy
 
The system is designed around a **base abstract account class**, from which specific account types inherit.
 
The account types implemented include:
 
- **Savings Account** – earns basic interest  
- **Current Account** – allows overdraft  
- **Interest Account** – earns higher interest  
 
This design ensures:
 
- Code reusability  
- Clear separation of responsibilities  
- Easy extensibility for future account types  
 
 
 
## Application of OOP Pillars
 
### Abstraction
 
Abstraction is applied by defining a base account structure that specifies **what every account must do**, without defining **how it should be done**.  
Each account type is required to implement its own interest calculation logic.
 
 
 
### Encapsulation
 
Encapsulation is achieved by protecting sensitive data such as account balance and ensuring it can only be modified through controlled methods like deposit and withdraw.
 
 
 
### Inheritance
 
Inheritance allows specific account types to reuse common functionality from the base account class while implementing their own unique behavior.
 
 
### Polymorphism
 
Polymorphism allows the same operation, such as interest calculation, to behave differently depending on the account type being used.
